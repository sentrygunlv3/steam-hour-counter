# Steam Hour Counter

counts steam hours when a non steam program is running\
so you can for example use the non steam version of blender and have steam count hours

to install you need to copy a `libsteam_api.so` file to the project root\
and then run `./install` to install the daemon/service files\
then you can enable and start it
